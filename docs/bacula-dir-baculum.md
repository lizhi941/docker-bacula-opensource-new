# Bacula-dir-baculum

* That bacula-dir-baculum only one more than bacula-dir is baculum-gui.

  The baculum-gui is a visual operation gui for bacula-dir's command line.


* we can make Bacula-dir-baculum base on bacula-dir.But base on which images?

  In the bacula-dir chapter, we build several images base on different system.

But because baculum needs the web environment(LNMP,LAMP), so we chose debian system that 

has a apache-php images.
